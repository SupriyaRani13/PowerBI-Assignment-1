Power BI Assignment 1


1.What do you mean by BI? Explain.

Ans: Business intelligence(BI) is software that ingests business data and presents it in user-friendly 
     views such as reports, dashboards, charts and graphs.
     
Applications of BI:
 
 a)Reporting and Visualization: Presenting the analyzed data in a visually appealing and understandable format,such as charts, graphs, dashboards, 
   and   reports

 b)Data Modeling: Structuring the integrated data to create a unified view of the business. This involves defining relationships, hierarchies,
   and dimensions to facilitate analysis.

 c)Data Integration: Gathering data from different sources such as databases, spreadsheets, and applications and consolidating it into a central repository.

 d)Data Governance and Security: Ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and security through proper data governance practices, including data 
   quality management, access controls, and compliance with regulations.

2.How Power-BI helps in BI, and how does it help Analysts? Explain.

    3.Data Visualization: Power BI offers a rich set of visualization options, including charts, graphs, maps, and tables
   
    4.Interactive Analysis: Power BI allows analysts to perform interactive analysis by slicing and filtering data, drilling down into details.

    5.Collaboration and Sharing: Power BI enables analysts to collaborate with colleagues and share their reports and dashboards securely.

    6.Integration with Other Tools: Power BI integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft tools such as Excel, Azure services, and SQL Server.

3.Explain Descriptive analytics?

Ans: Descriptive analytics is a branch of analytics that focuses on understanding historical data to gain insights into past events, trends, and patterns.
     It involves analyzing and summarizing data to describe what has happened in the past, without attempting to explain why or predict future outcomes.

    The key characteristics:
    
     a)Historical Analysis: Descriptive analytics looks at historical data to understand past events and trends.
    
     b)Data Aggregation and Summary: Descriptive analytics involves aggregating and summarizing data to provide a high-level overview
       and meaningful insights. 
     
     c)Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Descriptive analytics often focuses on analyzing key performance indicators, 
      which are quantifiable metrics that reflect the performance of a business process or an organization. 
    

4.Explain Predictive analytics?

Ans:a)Predictive analytics is a branch of analytics that leverages historical data and statistical algorithms to make predictions and forecasts 
      about future events or outcomes. It involves analyzing patterns, relationships, and trends in historical data to develop models 
      that can be used to predict future behavior or trends.

     b)Predictive analytics is the process of using data to forecast future outcomes. The process uses data analysis, machine learning, 
       artificial intelligence, and statistical models to find patterns that might predict future behavior.

     c)Prescriptive analytics is a form of data analytics that helps businesses make better and more informed decisions. 
       Its goal is to help answer questions about what should be done to make something happen in the future.

     d)It analyzes raw data about past trends and performance through machine learning (so very little human input, if any at all) 
       to determine possible courses of action or new strategies generally for the near term.
   
     e)It's possible that it might refer to a specialized or industry-specific term that is not widely recognized or established.
